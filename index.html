    <h2>My PCR Activity</h2>
    <p>    For my PCR activity I decided to chose my study abroad program in category #2, my study abroad program was Spanish at the advanced level, as well as hospitality and mangament. My study abroad program was through ISA (International Sudies Associastion). I studied Spanish at the advanced level in Salamanca, Spain. After this program I went to Florence, Italy and studied hospitality and managment. These programs have taught me about international affiairs as well as how to communicate with those who are not from the United States. Through these programs I became fluent in Spanish as well as developed a deeper understanind for fine dining expirences as well as cafe style enviorments in Florence, Italy.
